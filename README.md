# Automation exercise

We want to test the interaction of a client and a server app.

There are two trivial apps written in Kotlin in the project, both using JavaFX
for the UI (which is something that we're currently using for our desktop apps
in production).

Both apps show a simple UI (just for testing purposes).

We want to test the interaction between both, where client will send a message
to the server app and get a response back.

You can use any tool that you consider useful, and we will appreciate a simple
writting stating why did you use the tool, some pros and cons and also other
possible options and alternatives.

The exercise is meant to be solved in 1-2 hours. It is not meant to be
production code, but something that works and some explanations how will you
have productized that (e.g. simple class hierarchy). Also, if the solution
will take more than 2 hours, we expect some basic code or samples, and a write
out with the explanation how this will be used to build the final tests.
